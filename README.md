# save-data-copy-tool

Copy save data between gamecard and digital versions of games on Nintendo 3DS.

Insert a game card, run the software, choose the destination, and hope it works.

## Why use this?

Unlike Checkpoint, this works even if the target game was not started yet, giving it a chance to format the save archive. It automatically formats the target save using the same settings as the source.

Unlike Save Data Transfer Tool, this allows for transferring from digital to gamecard. It also does not erase the source savegame.
